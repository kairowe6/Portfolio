      <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
      <p>
        This site is my space to share the work I’ve done and the lessons I’ve learned, in a way that makes
        sense in today’s world—one where artificial intelligence is reshaping how we all think about coding,
        learning, and building.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My career started in IT staging. It was a crash course in touching more systems than I probably
        should have been trusted with. Working at a startup gave me the kind of freedom that fuels rapid
        growth. It was the kind of environment where stepping outside your comfort zone wasn’t a liability—it
        was expected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even in my first year, I was chasing efficiency. I built small Python command-line wizards that
        generated pfSense configuration files, shaving hours off repetitive tasks. Later, I moved into
        service delivery, working directly with customers to integrate the very systems I had staged. That
        role carried a different kind of stress and forced me to become reliable under pressure. It also
        showed me how error-prone human processes can be, no matter how skilled the people involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those lessons pushed me into automation. My first automation initiative focused on making staging
        consistent and repeatable, eliminating human mistakes. It worked beautifully—right up until the
        moment someone wanted to change a “tiny” detail I hadn’t built in as a variable. That failure was a
        turning point. In the second iteration, I had to design not just for the known variables, but also
        for the unknowns. That mindset—planning for what you can’t predict—was the moment I crossed
        into being an engineer capable of delivering systems and products above industry standard.

      <h2>The Role of AI in My Work</h2>
      <p>
        Let’s be honest: most guides, tutorials, and “learn to code” content have been fundamentally altered
        by AI. Pretending otherwise would be disingenuous. I use AI—a lot. But I don’t see it as a crutch.
        To me, AI has shifted my attention away from manually writing every line of code and toward
        designing entire systems. It allows me to abstract my thoughts, focus on architecture, and spend my
        time solving the bigger problems rather than grinding out boilerplate.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this new landscape, the value of an engineer isn’t just writing good code. Anyone with an AI assistant
        can now produce decent code with minimal training. The real value lies in guiding
        projects: selecting frameworks, designing the moving parts, moving information efficiently, and
        maintaining logical flow across the entire system. AI can amplify those skills, but it can’t replace
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        That doesn’t mean you can skip learning how to code. As good as AI is, you still have to proofread,
        debug, and apply judgment. AI can’t yet deduce the best solution to a complex issue on its own.
        Working with it often feels like coding in English—you still need to break down problems, decide on
        the right approach, and feed it crystal-clear instructions. People who try to “throw AI at the
        problem” usually end up with half-baked code littered with placeholders like
        <code>'/path/to/your/file'</code>. AI is powerful, but only in the hands of someone who knows how to
        direct it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This philosophy will guide how I write my blog posts and structure this portfolio. I won’t be writing
        endless “how to code” tutorials—that part is mostly obsolete. Instead, I’ll focus on explaining the design
        and decision-making process: how to select the right tools, how to structure a system, and how to
        think like an engineer in the modern era.

      <h2>What to Expect Here</h2>
      <p>
        This site is not just a showcase of my projects. It’s a reflection of my approach to engineering in
        the age of AI: embracing the tools we have, thinking carefully about design, and building systems
        that last. If you’re here for step-by-step coding tutorials, you won’t find many. What you will find
        is something more useful: insight into the thought process behind complex systems and the philosophy
        that drives them.
